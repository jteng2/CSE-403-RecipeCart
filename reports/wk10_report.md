# Team Report

### Last week's goals

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Implement Mongo connection in data access layer. Implement login validation for the routes that need it.
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): Start working on implementing the API routes provided by the back end team.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason):

### Progress and Issues

Generally, we addressed the feedback given by our peer reviewers, which mainly involved adding more details in the documentation.

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): While we did work on Mongo, we unfortunately didn't finish the implementation on time, so the final released used the (working, tested, and documented) hash-table/file-system implementation of the data access layer. Also, login validation was implemented in the frontend.
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): For the front end, we ended up getting some of the use cases working and having the various pages connected to the back end. Additonally, we got authentication
working on the front end.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason):

# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals

- Charles: Implement login validation. If possible, figure out a way to test the backend-frontend connector that works with `./gradlew`. 
- Devi: Finish the mongo data entry script. Work with others in the backend to do the database connections.
- Ricky: This week I plan to get these API routes implemented in the front end so that the front end is populated with dynamic data.
- Caleb: This week I will work to implement the API routes into the frontend and finish off the list of features our website is expected to have.
- Jason: Work towards whatever else needs to be completed and help finish connecting to mongo.

### Progress and Issues

- Charles: Added a couple more API routes/use cases (e.g. "Search for ingredient"), supplementary to the main use cases. Addressed user feedback by adding more documentation, in the top-level `*.md` files and in the Javadocs. Helped with the Mongo implementation, even if implementation of it wasn't finished.
- Devi: 
- Ricky: Implemented search onto the search page. Build/Designed the tile that would be on the recipe search page and saved recipes page.
- Caleb: This week I finalized user login and tracking throughout the website. Additionally, I connected the saved recipes page with the backend and finished the profile page and the add recipe page.
- Jason: Helped mongo related things for backend such as saving/loading entities and connection.
