# Team Report

### Last week's goals

As a whole, implement CI to automatically run a collection of unit tests on each commit. 
- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Get the backend to communicate with a Mongo database. Implement a use case. Write tests that covers that use case (and stuff it depends on).
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): Finalize user authentication and tracking througout website. Fully functional components. Display dynamic data from backend.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason):

### Progress and Issues

The frontend made progress on making the RecipeCart use cases doable on the website. The backend worked on making tests based on the starter code, and implementing some of the starter code.

### This week's goals

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Finish coding use-cases and connecting to mongo
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky):
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): 

Also, establish some protocol for communication between the front-end and back-end parts of the system (i.e. how to structure HTTP requests/responses), and document this protocol.

# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals
- Charles: Implement communication between the backend and frontend, and write tests for the testable parts of that module. If time allows, write tests for/implement more use cases. 
- Devi: In the coming week I hope to finish the database with the starter data and write the requests to the database so it can be accessed. This will help complete a few of use cases and major goals.
- Ricky: This week I plan to design and build components such as our search result/saved recipes recipe cards and account/settings info component. Furthermore, we plan to write tests since we are behind on our tests.
- Caleb: This week I will work on user authentication and tracking throughout the website. This took a lower priority this week than originally planned due to the lack of connection to API. 
- Jason: Finish writing code for back-end to make it mostly operational, and when finished, write tests/debug problems for back-end.

### Progress and Issues

- Charles: This week I implemented (and wrote tests for) another use case (creating a recipe) in the backend, and I got the backend to be able to connect with the frontend (i.e. implemented the API routes). I also implemented the main method, so the backend can now actually run; although, it uses the "mock" data access layer that was used for testing other parts of the backend. Although the connection seems to work, I didn't get enough time to write the tests for it.
- Devi: This week I helped with the implementation and documentation reports, reviewing the user and developer documenst, and building the backend databases. I finished adding the started database and adding the schema to the github. I also set up meeting events ahead of time to create a better meeting plan.
- Ricky:
- Caleb: This week I helped implement a few more features on the front-end and did research for user-authentication. I helped figure out GitHub Issues and documented the setup process for hosting and using the frontend.
- Jason:  Written code to connect to mongo and access collections. Not fully done, but got a way to connect to mongo.
### This week's goals
- Charles: Write tests for the backend part of the frontend-backend connector. Implement and write tests for more use cases.
- Devi: Next week, I hope to be working on a remaining use cases and do research for the login component.
- Ricky:
- Caleb: This week I will finalize user authentication and update our existing use cases to properly access the database via our RESTful API. Additionally, I will finalize the user profile page to work with user login. 
- Jason: Finish connecting to mongo and help with any tests.
