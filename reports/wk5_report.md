# Team Report

### Last week's goals
- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design/setup database in Mongo and allow users to be able to login using an email/username and password.
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): This week our goal is to complete the architecture and design milestone which is due on 1/31.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design the recipe page

### Progress and Issues

We have done a lot of reserach on auth0 and we think it would be a good choice for our web server for login authentication and for security reasons
too. Back-end has designed what the software architecture would look like, ___


### This week's goals

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Setup Gradle for automated testing, write tests, get some starter code based on
architecture and design, and setup a server to connect to front-end.
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky):
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): Designing menu/other pages.

# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals
- Charles: Revise the ER diagram and Mongo DB schema if needed, come up with the architecture and design for the backend, get some spec for the backend based on the design, learn some more about SparkJava and using Mongo with Java.
- Devi: Work on the ER diagram and create an endpoint for the front-end. Start organizing the various databases.
- Ricky: Help complete our architecture and design milestone which includes: having the login page complete, having API calls to the backend working, and having a page set up that displays the recipes.
- Caleb: Meet with the front-end team to devise architecture schema. Decide on login page authentication service and setup routes to access backend API.
- Jason: Learn more about Mongo and transform our E/R diagram into a setup for a database in Mongo. Also work towards users being able to login with an email/username and password.

### Progress and Issues

- Charles: I went into detail on the architecture and design for the backend (including details what classes there will be, what components they will form, and what has dependencies on what).

### This week's goals

- Charles: Set up Gradle for the project, make starter code based on the architecture and design (ideally with javadocs for important methods), help write tests for the backend.
