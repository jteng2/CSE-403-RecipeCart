# Team Report

### Last week's goals
(this can be empty this week)

### Progress and Issues

We completed the Requirements document (though, requirements could be changed in the future). What worked was having the group get together (online/in real life) to work on the document, so that we could share our ideas with each other. What we learned was how we'll break down the project into different areas, as well as how we'll work as a team on these different areas. Where we had some trouble was finalizing the schedules (i.e. structuring it so there's four deadlines). Since the document is complete, there isn't anything we're stuck on in terms of just this document. 

### This week's goals

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design and setup the databases and login system's backend
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): Design and setup the login system's front-end, API calls to the backend (at least for logging in), and the front-end for a recipe page (i.e. displaying a page for a recipe)
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design what a page for a recipe will look like/the page's structure

# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals
(this can be empty this week)

### Progress and Issues

- Charles: I helped complete the Requirements document this week. What worked was being able to communicate with my group for things I wasn't so sure about. I learned better how I can work with my team members to do this project. Where I had trouble was conceptualizing a schedule for making this project. Something we're stuck on (for next week) is choosing which type of specific database (SQL, Mongo, etc.) to use.
- Devi: I helped write the Requirements document, schedule and plan meetings, set milestons, and build roles. Individually, I did my section of the use case and set up our meetings. I struggled to sync the milestones for front-end and back-end while also maintaining a similar workload. I also struggled with creating realistic goals given the busy quarter. We are currently choosing between SQL and Mongo (I know SQL, but Mongo is also a good option).
- Ricky: I helped complete the Requirements document this week. Individually, I worked on a use case for our project. While collaborating with my team, I helped with figuring out the different sections of our Requirements document. I learned how to write to a Requirements document for a project. As well as, learning to discuss and collaborate with my team on  what we want for our project. I had trouble figuring out a use case for our project at the beginning but after taking time to think about how the application could be used, I was able to come with a case. Something that the team is stuck on is figuring out all the software tools we will need to complete this project. For example, we still have to figure out what type of database management system will should go with. We will probably consult with our Project Manager to figure this.
- Caleb: I worked on the Requirements document this week. Using Discord to schedule a meeting, we first met online and then in person to complete this document. Now, I better understand some of the visions my group members have for this project. I had trouble setting some milestones for the sub-group I am part of. One thing I am currently stuck on is determining which is the best approach for user authentication.
- Jason: I helped complete the Requirements document, general commmunication, and milestone planning. Our form of communication (discord) has been going well and we try to respond within reasonable periods of time. I learned how much planning is required for a project like this and how planning the project is probably the most immportant part. I struggled trying to think of how to space milestones apart. I think we are stuck on trying to choose the right database to use.

### This week's goals

- Charles: (help) come up with the architecture and design for the backend, especially for the databases to be used and the login system, and also (help) set up these systems.
- Devi: Help to start the database architecture for the backend and create an endpoint for front-end to access. General planning with the back-end team to make a weekly goal schedule and our own progress meetings.
- Ricky: Help with the front-end design along with working on some of the pages that will be needed such as the login page.
- Caleb: This week I want to dive more into the variety of services offered for user authentication and determine which one works best for our team. Additionally, I would like to get in touch with the backend team to come up with a loose framework for how our frontend/backend interaction is going to communicate.
- Jason: Help layout the foundation the Architecture & Design milestones for the backend and user interface. Help try to come to a conclusion on which database to use for our needs. This would include setting up a login system and starting to design a recipe page.
