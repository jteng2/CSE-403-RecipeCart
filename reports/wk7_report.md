# Team Report

### Last week's goals

As a whole, implement CI to automatically run a collection of unit tests on each commit. 
- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Get the backend to communicate with a Mongo database. Implement a use case. Write tests that covers that use case (and stuff it depends on).
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): Finalize user authentication and tracking througout website. Fully functional components. Display dynamic data from backend.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason):

### Progress and Issues

The frontend made progress on making the RecipeCart use cases doable on the website. The backend worked on making tests based on the starter code, and implementing some of the starter code.

### This week's goals

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Implement connection to Mongo. Implement communication between frontend and backend. Implement more use cases. Write any more needed tests for each.
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): Get the add recipe feature working. Build components such as the saved recipes/search result recipe cards and the account info component. Write more tests for the components we have and the components we plan to build. Get user tracking throughout the website working.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): 

Also, establish some protocol for communication between the front-end and back-end parts of the system (i.e. how to structure HTTP requests/responses), and document this protocol.

# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals
- Charles: Help write more unit tests for the backend, especially for the use case that will be implemented for beta release. Implement that use case.
- Devi: I plan to finish database setup, write tests and starter code, and create some initial database calls.
- Ricky: This week I plan to build core react components. This includes the various ways to display the recipe to users, the shopping item component, and the acount info component. Furthermore, I plan to implement call to the backend API to populate the front end components. Additionally, I will write tests for the components.
- Caleb: This week I am going to finalize the majority of components necessary for our website. Additionally, I am going to implement user tracking throughout the app. I will also expand our unit testing environment. Lastly, I will work with the backend team to finalize a protocol for communication with the API.
- Jason: I want to help write unit tests/starter code for back-end and continue helping setup MongoDB.

### Progress and Issues

- Charles: I wrote tests for the data access layer, for the business logic entities, and for the one use case we decided to do for the beta release. The business logic entities and that one use case are implemented and pass all tests, but they aren't currently used due to lack of connection of backend and frontend. I also designed some API routes for backend-frontend communication, but haven't implemented that yet.
- Devi:
- Ricky: I helped build some of the core react components that we needed. I still plan to build the account info component and shopping item component. I set up some dummy data which we used for our components when doing our demo. Furthermore, I still have to write tests for our components.
- Caleb:
- Jason: I helped write starter code for back-end, but haven't written any tests. Charles has done most of the back-end testing/starter code. We haven't gotten Mongo setup yet, but we plan to today/tomorrow.

### This week's goals

- Charles: Implement communication between the backend and frontend, and write tests for the testable parts of that module. If time allows, write tests for/implement more use cases. 
- Devi: 
- Ricky: This week I plan to design and build components such as our search result/saved recipes recipe cards and account/settings info component. Furthermore, we plan to write tests since we are behind on our tests.
- Caleb:
- Jason: Finish writing code for back-end to make it mostly operational, and when finished, write tests/debug problems for back-end.
