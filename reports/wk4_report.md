# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals
- Charles: (help) come up with the architecture and design for the backend, especially for the databases to be used and the login system, and also (help) set up these systems.
- Devi: Help to start the database architecture for the backend and create an endpoint for front-end to access. General planning with the back-end team to make a weekly goal schedule and our own progress meetings.
- Ricky: Help with the front-end design along with working on some of the pages that will be needed such as the login page.
- Caleb: This week I want to dive more into the variety of services offered for user authentication and determine which one works best for our team. Additionally, I would like to get in touch with the backend team to come up with a loose framework for how our frontend/backend interaction is going to communicate.
- Jason: Help layout the foundation the Architecture & Design milestones for the backend and user interface. Help try to come to a conclusion on which database to use for our needs. This would include setting up a login system and starting to design a recipe page.
