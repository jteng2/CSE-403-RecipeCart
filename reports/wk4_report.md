# Team Report

### Last week's goals
- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design and setup the databases and login system's backend
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): Design and setup the login system's front-end, API calls to the backend (at least for logging in), and the front-end for a recipe page (i.e. displaying a page for a recipe)
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design what a page for a recipe will look like/the page's structure

### Progress and Issues

We were able to set up the git repository on Github and set up the directory structure where we have a front-end, back-end, and reports directory. Additionally, we made our necessary changes to the living document based on our feedback. We learned a good way to set up our file structure which was to have a front-end and back-end file. Furthermore, we added a reports directory for our weekly status reports. For the front-end team, we still are still trying to figure out the login system as well as our recipe page which we would like to display for users.

### This week's goals

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design/setup database in Mongo and allow users to be able to login using an email/username and password.
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): This week our goal is to complete the architecture and design milestone which is due on 1/31.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): Design the recipe page

# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals
- Charles: (help) come up with the architecture and design for the backend, especially for the databases to be used and the login system, and also (help) set up these systems.
- Devi: Help to start the database architecture for the backend and create an endpoint for front-end to access. General planning with the back-end team to make a weekly goal schedule and our own progress meetings.
- Ricky: Help with the front-end design along with working on some of the pages that will be needed such as the login page.
- Caleb: This week I want to dive more into the variety of services offered for user authentication and determine which one works best for our team. Additionally, I would like to get in touch with the backend team to come up with a loose framework for how our frontend/backend interaction is going to communicate.
- Jason: Help layout the foundation the Architecture & Design milestones for the backend and user interface. Help try to come to a conclusion on which database to use for our needs. This would include setting up a login system and starting to design a recipe page.

### Progress and Issues

- Charles: 
- Devi: 
- Ricky: I helped make some fixes for our living document based on the feedback that we had received. Also, I spent some time learning a bit about the front-end framework we plan to use to create the front-end of the application. An issue/problem we had was that we had initally created our remote repository on gitlab instead of github so we had to move all our work to github.  
- Caleb: 
- Jason: I helped revise and draw an E/R diagram for our major components, fixed some "expected revisions" on our living document, and helped setup GitHub.

### This week's goals

- Charles: 
- Devi: 
- Ricky: Help complete our architecture and design milestone which includes: having the login page complete, having API calls to the backend working, and having a page set up that displays the recipes.
- Caleb: 
- Jason: Learn more about Mongo and transform our E/R diagram into a setup for a database in Mongo. Also work towards users being able to login with an email/username and password.
