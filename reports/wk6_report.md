# Team Report

### Last week's goals

As a whole, implement CI to automatically run a collection of unit tests on each commit. 
- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Setup Gradle for automated testing, write tests, get some starter code based on architecture and design, and setup a server to connect to front-end.
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): Setup Jest for unit testing. Implement functional components using React based on goals in Milestone Schedule. Track authentication by user throughout website navigation.
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason): Designing menu/other pages.

### Progress and Issues

The frontend made progress on building functionality on the website that users will go to for RecipeCart. The backend made starter code based on the architecture and design, which can now be implemented. We set up the CI system so that it checks if both the front-end and back-end properly build/pass tests/etc. on the remote repository.

### This week's goals

- Back-end (Devi, Charles, Jason): Get the backend to communicate with a Mongo database. Implement a use case. Write tests that covers that use case (and stuff it depends on).
- Front-end (Caleb, Ricky): 
- UI design (Devi, Charles, Jason):

Also, establish some protocol for communication between the front-end and back-end parts of the system (i.e. how to structure HTTP requests/responses), and document this protocol.

# Individual Contributions

### Last week's goals
- Charles: Set up Gradle for the project, make starter code based on the architecture and design (ideally with javadocs for important methods), help write tests for the backend.
- Devi: This week, I hope to set up the Gradle and write some request endpoints. This will include starting to put the ER diagram plan into code. I will also help with testing.
- Ricky: This week, I plan to add functionality to the components on the home page. Additonally, I plan write unit tests that will be used in our CI pipeline using Jest. 
- Caleb: This week I will setup Jest and write some basic unit tests to implement into our CI pipeline. Additionally, I will solidify the login experience to track the authentication token necessary for calling the API. Finally, I will help to create functional components for the website, including a logo, a profile page, and a search bar for finding recipes.
- Jason: I want to help setup Gradle and potentially write out the project specs based off of the architeture and design and create tests before we start coding to create the idea of "blackbox" testing.

### Progress and Issues

- Charles: I successfully set up Gradle (so that the project builds, runs tests, lints, etc.), helped set up the CI, and wrote starter code for the whole backend (there is getter/setter/constructor/builder functionality, but everything else is left unimplemented). I also made javadocs detailing the backend. Although, setting up detailed starter code left little time to write tests for them.

### This week's goals

- Charles: Help write more unit tests for the backend, especially for the use case that will be implemented for beta release. Implement that use case.
