This folder (databaseSchemas) contains information about the structure of the
databases. There are 4: user, recipe, tag, and ingredients. Because of the document
structure in MONGO.db, each user, recipe, tag, and ingredient will be represented
as it's own document.

See the files in this folder for more details about the database structure.
