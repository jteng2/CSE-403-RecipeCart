# A high level description of RecipeCart:

# How to install the software:
1. Clone this repository onto your local machine.
2. Perform the rest of the steps for building the software as described in the README.md in the top-level directory of the repository.
# How to run (start) the software:
1. First make sure the software is installed.
2. Then, to run the backend part of the software, run the command `./gradlew run` in the same directory as `gradlew`. Or, if you're using IntelliJ, you can also do this Gradle task from the Gradle tab on the IntelliJ GUI. Another option for running the backend is with the .jar file. Building the software produces an executable .jar file, which will be located in the `build/libs` folder that's created after building. To run this .jar, go to this directory in your terminal, then run `java -jar <filename>`, where `<filename>` is the name of the .jar file. Make sure you have Java installed.
3. To run the frontend part of the software,

# How to use the software:
- After starting the software, connect to the website address that's specified in the README.md, via web browser. This will take you to the RecipeCart website, where the various use cases can be performed. (This website will already be connected to the backend.) Currently, the only use cases that are functional are searching for recipes and creating new recipes (the rest of the use-cases are not yet functional).
