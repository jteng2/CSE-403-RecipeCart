CSE 403 RecipeCart

The top-level README should briefly describe the idea and goals of your project and explain the layout of the repository.

Introduction
RecipeCart an application where users can search, save, upload, and rate recipes, and ingredients for these recipes can be added to a built-in shopping list. A common problem that people face when cooking recipes is getting the right amount of ingredients based on what they already have in their selves and fridges. This aims to achieve a seamless integration of finding and cooking recipes, and shopping for (remaining) ingredients needed for these recipes. Technology-wise, the application will be a web app, where the user can login and get recipes and other information from a server.
