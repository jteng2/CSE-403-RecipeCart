# CSE-403-RecipeCart

# Introduction
RecipeCart an application where users can search, save, upload, and rate recipes, and ingredients for these recipes can be added to a built-in shopping list. A common problem that people face when cooking recipes is getting the right amount of ingredients based on what they already have in their selves and fridges. This aims to achieve a seamless integration of finding and cooking recipes, and shopping for (remaining) ingredients needed for these recipes. Technology-wise, the application will be a web app, where the user can login and get recipes and other information from a server.

# Goals
## Major Features
- User-uploaded local storage of ingredients and amounts (manually)
  - Optional to the user; other features should work but may have less functionality
  - User would need to create an account/log in for this

- Default database of recipes supplied to user
- Search recipes with toggle for already-acquired/needs-shopping
  - Filter recipes based on size, time, skill level, dietary requirements
- Grocery list that the user can add ingredients to
  - Add a recipeâ€™s (missing) ingredients directly to it

## Stretch Goals
